This exercise reviews some of the basic concepts we have learned:

* the command line
* git
* classes
* hashes
* arrays
* variables
* conditional statements

You should have already cloned the ctd2 repository into your c9 workspace.
Change the directory to ctd2, and enter the command

touch myclass.rb

Now run

ruby tester.rb

and follow the instructions until you are able to complete all of the tests.
You will have to make changes to myclass.rb.

Now, suppose you don't remember how to create a class or a hash or an array.
Look it up on Google! Use search arguments like "ruby create a class".

Once you have it working, type this in the command line:

git add -A

git commit -m "Got myclass.rb working"

git push

Then, go to the mastermind directory and start that exercise.
